# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created as a starting project by boot camp students as a part of their Prework. It prepared students in two ways. First it helped them build their first project. Secondly, it contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Each of those sections contain tips and hints and act as a reference point for future usage as students and in their future profession. The great part about this project is that the students may always add on more notes as they please and build this study guide as much as possible.
