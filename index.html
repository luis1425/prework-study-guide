          <li> <b>Internal style sheet </b> contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. </li>

          <li> When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head. </li>
          <li> Declarations include the CSS property and value of that property </li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li> Example of variable: var shapes = ["circle", "square", "triangle"]; </li>
          <li> console.log(shapes[1]); to see the string square in console </li>
          <li> for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) {
            console.log(shapes[x]);
           } </li>

          block of code to be executed if second condition is truthy; } </li>
          <li> var studentInfo = ["Lu", 54, true]; </li>
          <li> "Lu" is a string, 54 is a number, and true is a Boolean value so they do not require quotations </li>
          <li> Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable. </li>
